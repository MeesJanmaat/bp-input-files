This repository contains all input files used for the examples presented in the report "Band unfolding for first-principles supercell calculations".

Note that these input files require a precalculated potential as they only run the job `BANDS`. The input files work as-is if a Spex DFT run was performed beforehand (and thus a `spex.pot` file exists). For potentials calculated using other codes, please refer to the Spex manual for instructions.
